- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ErayBalkaya
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in analyzing data
- As an experienced professional with a background in running my own businesses for several years, I have developed strong problem-solving and decision-making skills. Recently, I completed a comprehensive 12-month
data analysis bootcamp,where I gained proficiency in tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and data visualization platforms. My diverse experience allows me to approach analyticalchallenges with a strategic mindset,
